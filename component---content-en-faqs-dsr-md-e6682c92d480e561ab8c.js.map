The exception being that it is not possible for the DSR to be set to a negative rate with the current code-base. In theory, it’s possible for MKR governors to commission a rewrite of the code to be able to support negative rates. Whether this would make sense is another question. Negative rates on the DSR might not be effective, since users would simply withdraw their Dai.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Does Dai automatically earn the DSR?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`No. Dai only earns the rate if it is deposited into the DSR smart-contract.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Is the DSR its own smart contract?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Yes, the DSR is a part of the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module\"\n      }}>{`Rates Module.`}</a>{` This module is responsible for collecting Stability Fees and distributing Dai to DSR users.

Raising the DSR incentivizes users to hold more Dai, leading to higher demand for Dai, whereas lowering the DSR has the opposite effect of reducing demand for Dai. This is reflected in the spot market price of Dai; if Dai is trading below a dollar, then the DSR can be raised to increase demand for Dai which would bring up the price of Dai. Conversely, if Dai is trading above a dollar, then the DSR can be lowered to reduce the demand for holding Dai which may help bring down the price of Dai.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Where can someone find information to better understand the economic impact of the DSR?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://awesome.makerdao.com/#in-depth-analysis\"\n      }}>{`In-Depth Analysis`}</a>{` section of the Awesome-MakerDAO resource library offers comprehensive literature on this topic.
