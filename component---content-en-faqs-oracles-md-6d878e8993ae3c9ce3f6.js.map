MakerDAO Oracles receive data from a number of independent Feeds that consist of individuals and organizations. Each Oracle corresponds to a single asset and its reference price.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How does the Oracle system work?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In the Maker Protocol, each collateral type has a corresponding Oracle that publishes a reference price that the system uses.

The Medianizer is sent data through a system of Feeds and relayers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Each Feed uses a tool called `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/makerdao/setzer-mcd\"\n      }}>{`Setzer`}</a>{` which pulls the median price from a set of exchanges and then pushes it to a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://scuttlebot.io/more/protocols/secure-scuttlebutt.html\"\n      }}>{`Secure Scuttlebutt Network`}</a>{` that has relayers reading from it.

At the launch of Multi-Collateral Dai, Oracles received data from a total of 20 Feeds which consisted of 15 individuals and five public organizations. The Oracles use the median of the reported prices for each asset as the reference price. Using a median instead of an average makes it harder to manipulate the reference price since control over half of the data providers is needed in order for a fraudulent price to be pushed through. Additionally, using a median naturally filters out irregular price data.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In addition to this, the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/oracle-module/oracle-security-module-osm-detailed-documentation\"\n      }}>{`Oracle Security Module(OSM)`}</a>{` safeguards the process by delaying price-feed data for one hour.

On the other hand, if the price of ETH was reported to be artificially high, say $1,000,000.00, then any ETH Vault owner would be able to issue an excessive amount of Dai since the system thinks there is more Collateral value than there actually is. Oracle attacks can be very profitable for a successful attacker and can be very disruptive to MakerDAO and its users.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Who are the Feeds?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The Feeds are a mix of pseudonymous individuals and public organizations. Individuals consist of people internal to Maker, influential people in the greater crypto community, as well as some community members. The organizations involved in being Feeds at the launch of MCD can be found in the ratified `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmpem83sxjjwe1jvn2csdtetn4r3j95ejuzpbmtxef4lu5\"\n      }}>{`DeFi Feeds proposal`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Why are organizational Feeds public, while individual Feeds are pseudonymous?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`From their onset, the individuals running Feeds have been pseudonymous out of necessity, to protect the individuals from the risk of extortion and blackmail. Pseudonymous Feeds also have the benefit of making it harder to coordinate an Oracle attack since the Feeds don’t know who the others are. Organizations running Feeds, however, are different. Organizations are much more resilient against coercion, have the resources to combat malicious actors, and have their reputations at stake. This makes them much better equipped to be Feeds with public identities. A hybrid model is optimal, one that incorporates the benefits of both individual and organizational Feeds.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What is the process for becoming a Feed?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`All new Feeds go through MakerDAO’s `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"governance.md\"\n      }}>{`governance`}</a>{` in order to be added in. There is currently no formal way for Feeds to be added to the Maker Protocol.

A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply identities can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically.\"`}</p>\n    <p>{`The short answer is yes, the Oracle system is resistant to Sybil attacks because of the existence of a whitelist for Feeds. It's not simple to become a Feed, they need to be approved by MKR `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"governance.md\"\n      }}>{`governance.`}</a>{` Therefore, an attacker cannot gain a majority influence by creating many pseudo-feeds.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What happens if there is a flash crash on an exchange?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Since the reference price published by the Oracles is a median of the median prices that are reported by at least 20 different Feeds, outliers are automatically filtered out.
