While some Vault types are permissionless others may carry requirements. Typically there are no requirements related to prior borrowing history or cumbersome application processes since Vaults are configured according to the risk profile of the underlying Collateral that is being used.

Any Vault with Generated Dai has a Liquidation Price, the price of the underlying asset at which one's Vault would be liquidated. Using a Vault for leverage introduces additional risk. The potential for reward is higher through leverage, but the potential for loss is magnified as well.
